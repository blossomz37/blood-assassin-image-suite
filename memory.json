      "problems": [
        "Images failed to embed - generated-images directory not found in expected path",
        "Claude's container cannot directly access user's local filesystem (/Users/carlo/...) for binary files",

      "solutions": [
        "Created Python script (add_images_to_dossier.py) that user runs locally with direct filesystem access - SUCCESSFUL",
        "Alternative workflow: User uploads files to chat → Claude processes in container → User downloads result",

      "notes": [
        "First attempt completed at 12:48 PM but without images",
        "Created standalone Python script for local execution - user confirmed it worked with all 12 images",
        "Demonstrated container-based workflow with single image (Queen Lysandria portrait) at 8:20 PM",
